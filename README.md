## Motovation

The driving force behind this app was to use the ORM knowledge that I had just learnt from class and put it into practice - proving to myself that I know what I am learning

## Installation

Installation is easy! Copy the package from my repo and in the command line enter 'npm i' in order to download the dependances. Then you must source and seed the database using mysql2. Once this is done you can type 'npm start' and the app will run

## Challenges

I always find these tasks challenging when there is some starter code implemented. The code provided for the Product creation if found confusing and took me some time to desypher

## Successes

The greatest success was the feeling of almost complete understanding of that the task was asking. I was able to complete this assignment in record time and that achivement feels great
